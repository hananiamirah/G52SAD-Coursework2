
For the first part, I have altered some changes in the ImageView.fxml and also ImageView.java in order to be able to run the original code. 
Initially the code has a linking problem as the name of the file is not valid which results in error while running. 

As for the licensing, GitHub provides list of licenses options and it is depending on the developer to choose during the creation of 
the repository. providing an open source license allows other user to make modifications to the code rather than just enacting copyright
laws upon the code that it became vulnerable for other people to access. As for this source code, I would go with the MIT license which is 
not very strict and welcome all sort of modifications as long as the credits goes back to the original owner.
